## Scripts

Various scripts are provided in the package file, but many are helpers for other scripts; here are the ones you'll
commonly use:

- `dev`: starts the frontend and backend in dev mode, with file watching (note that the backend runs on port 3100, and the frontend is proxied to it).
- `e2e`: builds and starts the app in production mode and runs the Playwright tests against it.
  - `e2e:dev`: builds and starts the app in dev mode and runs the Playwright tests against it.
- `lint`: runs ESLint and Prettier against all the relevant files in the project.
- `serve`: builds and starts the app in production mode locally.
- `ship`: runs `lint`, then `test`, then `e2e`; ideal before a `git push`.
- `test`: runs the unit and integration tests.
  - `test:cover`: runs the tests and outputs coverage data.
